## Windows PE Builder for RiiConnect24 Patcher

This script will build the .ISO with Windows PE configured to run RiiConnect24 Patcher. It's for the folks that don't have Windows on their computers.

### Features
* Easy configuration.
* Everything is provided.

### How to build the ISO.
You should be building on Windows 10 (`tested on 2004, newer versions should work`).

- Install [Windows ADK for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) to default directory.
- Run build.bat. It will guide you through and automatically do everything.

>If you want to change something, modify the .bat or change files inside `source_files/`.
